Describe how you have handled persistence in the last three semesters. 
The considerations should include all relevant layers. File IO, Relational Databases, local storage and cookies in browsers. 

Answer: in the first and second semester we used a premade DBConnector that had to be implemented in a jsp web project,
and then we just called static DBConnector in a class with methods having to do with mysql data (getAllNames fx), also we used preparedstatements.
We used sessions and attributes to show data on the webpage from a servlet. We also learned that relational databases need a PK, FK and is data inside tables.
We also learned to use File IO to read or save data to a text file.
LocalStorage = store information locally (servlet)
On the third semester we used JPA mapping together with a persistence unit in a maven web project
Cookies are client-side files that contain user information, we learned about them in third semester but didnt use it that much (we just fetched everytime we needed info).
